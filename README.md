### Hey there! 👋

My name is Melvin, an experienced software developer from The Netherlands 🇳🇱 with a love for building great applications and solving complex problems in domains with a social purpose. 

I currently work as a lead engineer at [Yard Digital Agency](https://github.com/yardinternet) where I primarily focus on:

* 👏🏼 Building and evolving a strong Agile team of 7 engineers
* 🚀 Technological innovation and scaling of our community software, called [Yunits](https://www.yunits.com/).
* 📊 Data science and Machine Learning (Recommender systems, network analysis, NLP, visualization, ...)
* 🏛 Architecture of our applications and API's
* 🔐 Security & privacy

I've been programming since I was 12 years old and have been honing my skills ever since through work experience, reading, experimenting, and courses.
Check out my [Goodreads 📚](https://goodreads.com/melvinkoopmans) for an overview of the books that I've read.
